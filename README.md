# obsidian-templates-snippets
Obsidian templates, snippets, plugins and other third-party tooling that I use to improve. (Plan is to keep it simple so overhead is minimal - no extension rabbithole)

Enables [Cornell Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes) via CSS snippets.

1. Snippet: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nopshar/Cornell/main/Cornell.css
2. Template: https://gist.github.com/skrymets/0de27b2f577208cf254f4e69042b13ce

Note: Original author of the snippet is [skrymets](https://gist.github.com/skrymets), but [nopshar](https://gist.github.com/nopshar) fixed some rendering issues and that is why snippet is referring to [nopshar](https://gist.github.com/nopshar)'s fork.
